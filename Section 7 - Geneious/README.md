## Geneious
We will be using Geneious to visualize our mitogenomes.

### Read Assembly to Mitogenome
Create a new folder in Geneious for the workshop. Within this folder, create a separate folder for each of your samples.
Import your getorganelle contigs into their respective folders. Import your bowtie2_getorganelle BAM file into the same folder. We will examine these files.

### Mitogenome annotation
Import your MitoFinder spades and getorganelle contigs. There should be only one getorganelle contig, but there may be multiple spades contigs.  These will be labeled "xxxxx_contig.fasta or "xxxxx_contig_#.fasta", depending upon whether there is one or more than one contig. Next, import the .gff file that matches the imported contig. These are your annotated mitogenomes.
