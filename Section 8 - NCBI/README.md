## NCBI
Once you have a finished mitogenome, you will want to submit these to NCBI.


### Annotated mitogenome
We are going to go over submitting your complete, annotated mitogenomes through [BankIt](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/index.cgi), NCBI's web-based submission portal.

You will need three items, a [fasta file](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/html/help/fasta.html) of your genomes, a [Source Modifier Table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/html/help/genbank-source-table.html#modifiers), and a [Sequence Features Table](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/WebSub/html/annot_examples.html).
