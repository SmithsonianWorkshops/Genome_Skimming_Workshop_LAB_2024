## Working with many samples at one time

You've seen from the work we've done this week that to run each job for each samples takes significant hands-on time and is prone to errors from typos.

There are methods to automated the submission of job files. This reduces your time working the samples through Hydra, and with the power of the cluster being able to run many analyze at once, you can speed up the total analyses are running on the cluster (that is reduced "wall clock" time).
