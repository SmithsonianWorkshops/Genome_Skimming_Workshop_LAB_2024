# Intro to the Unix command line and Hydra

This portion of the workshop will have two components:

1. An introduction to using the Unix command line.
1. An introduction to using the Smithsonian's Hydra computing cluster.

If you already have command line expierence, the Unix intro is options. Similarly, if you already have Hydra experience, that is optional.

## Intro to the Unix command line

We will be using the Hydra cluster to learn Unix command line basics.

1. We'll start by a quick introduction to logging into Hydra <hydra_login.md>
1. Next, we'll use this [command line introduction](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/) lesson from the Carpentries organization.

Note: The Carpentries has several command line lessons. The one we're using is from a course in [High-Performance Computing](https://www.hpc-carpentry.org/) that is under development. This one is geared towards learning on a multi-user system like Hydra. Additional material will be from the Software Carpentry [Unix Shell lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
